## [0.4.1] - 2019-10-15
### Changed
- Renamed `irma session` flag `--authmethod` to `--auth-method` for consistency with server `Configuration` struct

### Fixed
- Fix bug that would prevent downloading of demo private keys of demo schemes on server startup and scheme updating
- `irma server` now respects the `disable_schemes_update` option like the `irmaserver` library (#63)
- Other small fixes


## [0.4.0] - 2019-10-09
### Added
- New irma server feature: static (e.g. printable) QRs that start preconfigured sessions, see [documentation](https://irma.app/docs/irma-server/#static-irma-qrs)
- irma server now returns attribute issuance time to the requestor after the session has finished

### Fixed
- Hopefully fix “unknown or expired session” errors that would sometimes occur in the IRMA app in bad network conditions
- Combined issuance-disclosure requests with two schemes one of which has a keyshare server now work as expected
- Various other bugfixes
